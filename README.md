# Project-Portfolio-Analyzing-and-Formatting-Superstore-Sales-Data

## Project Description
This project involves reformatting and analyzing Superstore sales data to answer critical business questions while addressing issues such as incorrect data types and missing values. The primary goal is to extract actionable insights that can inform business strategies and enhance overall performance.

The analysis will utilize a combination of Excel, SQL, and PowerBI, following a structured approach to ensure comprehensive and reliable results. The process will encompass six key parts of data analysis:

* [Defining the Problems](#1-defining-the-problems)
* [Data Preparation](#2-data-preparation)
* [Data Cleaning and Processing](#3-data-cleaning-and-processing)
* [Data Analysis](#4-data-analysis)
* [Data Visualization](#5-data-visualization)
* [Recommendations](#6-recommendations)
